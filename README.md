# Globanlist plugin for IW4MAdmin
## Introduction
Plugin to share banlist between clans. How it works ?
- When you ban a client, the ban will added to globanlist Database.
- When you unban a client, if client in globanlist, his bane will be deleted from globanlist Database.
- When a Banned client on globanlist Database joins your servers you will receive a notifications on discord.

## Installation
1. Copy Plugin in IW4MAdmin/plugins directory
2. Contact me on discord `Zwambro#8854` to create an token for your clan (You can't use this plugin without Token).
3. Create a discord webhook. 
4. Open plugin and past the token I sent you in `zwambroapi: ""`, and discord webhook url in `webhook: ""`.
5. visit [Zwambro.pw](https://zwambro.pw/) to see all bans.
